            <p> In the <a href="Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area">Urbana-Champaign area</a>, there is a wide variety of cuisine available from various types of Asian food such as Indian, Korean, and Chinese 
            to Italian food, and many large American food chains. The large seasonal population of students of the large UIUC university, along with the many employees of the univesity
            supports many restaurants and leads to this diversity of restaurants. Perhaps unsuprisingly, the Urbana-Champaign area was named as <em>Midwest Living’s</em> “<a href="https://www.midwestliving.com/travel/the-greatest-midwest-food-towns/">Greatest Midwest Food Town</a>” in 2017, with the area's diversity of cuisine, food trucks, 
            and prevalence of locally grown food ingredients used in restaurants all being cited.
